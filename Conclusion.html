<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana,arial,helvetica;color:#336699;font-size:11pt;">
In conclusion, Django is a powerful framework that automatically configures many apsects for fast and easy web development. It is able to support many different applications. One very outstanding characteristic of Django is database 
configurations, a lot of different databases can be easily configured by modifying the settings python file. 
<br/>
The installation was dreadfully easy, using the python package management system pip, installation can happen in only one line. 
Even your Grandma Could Do it! It definately outperformed our expectations, a lot of configurations were automatically done via command line interface.
However, there was some learning curve regarding the framework, since Django is abstract alot of different aspects were needed to run a web
application.

No we dont regret
